# Installation

[Have a look at our release page.](https://github.com/stagemonitor/stagemonitor-kibana/releases) Be sure to use the plugin version corresponding to your version of kibana, down to the minor patch level.

# Caveats

This plugin currently only works with Chrome and Firefox. Internet Explorer is not supported.

# Development

Start elasticsearch on your machine and run the following commands

    git clone https://github.com/elastic/kibana
    git checkout tags/v5.5.0
    npm install
    cd plugins
    git clone git@github.com:stagemonitor/stagemonitor-kibana.git
    cd stagemonitor-kibana
    npm install
    cd ../..
    npm start

Access Kibana under https://localhost:5601 -> the lazy optimizations may take some minutes for the initial pageload.

# Tests

In the tests folder, run the following command to run the tests on localhost:5601:

    ./gradlew test

If you are running the development instance you have to adjust the base url, as it will have a randomly generated suffix:

    ./gradlew test -Dgeb.build.baseUrlTest=https://localhost:5601/znr/
